This is a simple program in C that creates customized multiplication tables.
It gets two outputs from the user:
1. The number you want to begin the multiplication table
2. The number you want to end the multiplication table

For example, if you input '2' and '11', the output of the first table will be:

2 x 0 = 0
2 x 1 = 0
2 x 2 = 0
2 x 3 = 0
2 x 4 = 0
2 x 5 = 0
2 x 6 = 0
2 x 7 = 0
2 x 8 = 0
2 x 9 = 0
2 x 10 = 0
2 x 11 = 0

And the final table will be:

11 x 0 = 0
11 x 1 = 11
11 x 2 = 22
11 x 3 = 33
11 x 4 = 44
11 x 5 = 55
11 x 6 = 66
11 x 7 = 77
11 x 8 = 88
11 x 9 = 99
11 x 10 = 110
11 x 11 = 121
